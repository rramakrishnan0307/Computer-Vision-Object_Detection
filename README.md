# aicamp-Computer-Vision-Object_Detection

This webinar was presented by Sage Elliott (Sixgill). He was also available to help me as I created my own dataset and worked through this project.

This project shows how to build your own object detector to locate objects in images and videos with Facebook detectron2 
and cover practical data labeling methods for you to use in your own projects.
I created my own dataset with images of fighter Jets and used Sense Data Annotation tool to label the images.
Sign up for Sense Data Annotation at https://bit.ly/cv-label-aicamp. Try labeling images with rectangles or polygons.
